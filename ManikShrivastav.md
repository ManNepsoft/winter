# Project Name
Gesture Control Robot

## Summary
Gesture Robot is an electronic car controlled by the movement of circuit. It can be mostly used in real 
life robot fights and car fights. It is a car that can be controlled according to the userâ€™s movement of the 
hands. The transmitter part will be attached to the hand of the user and its receiver will act as the 
motherboard of the car. As the transmitter moves, it will send the signals to the receiver in the car and it 
will turn and run the car according to the instructions.

## Plan
First of all, the chassis of car is going to be made. It will contain four motors and rubber wheels attached 
to it. After that, the motors will be connected with motor shield driver. After that, the Arduino Nano is 
connected to the RF module and it acts as a transmitter with the power supply of li-ion battery. The
other Arduino Nano is connected with RF Module and ADLX335 Module and it acts as a receiver with 
power supply from 9V Battery. The code would be uploaded to both the Arduinos to make them 
transmit and receive signals and then the circuit works.
